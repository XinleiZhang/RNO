# Neural operator-enhanced resolvent method for predicting space-time flow statistics

- `./tutorials/white_noise_resolvent_prediction.py` predicts the velocity psectra using white-noise stochastic forcing
- `./tutorials/RNO-stf-180.py` predicts the colored-in-time stochastic forcing using trained DeepONet for $Re_\tau=180$ case
- `./tutorials/RNO-stf-550.py` predicts the colored-in-time stochastic forcing using trained DeepOnet for $Re_\tau=550$ case

Under development. DeepONet-based stochastic forcing will be updated soon.
